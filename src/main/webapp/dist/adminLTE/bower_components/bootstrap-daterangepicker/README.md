# Date Range Picker for Bootstrap

![Improvely.com](http://i.imgur.com/LbAMf3D.png)

This date range picker component for Bootstrap creates a dropdown menu from which a user can
select a range of dates. I created it while building the UI for [Improvely](http://www.improvely.com), 
which needed a way to select date ranges for reports.

Features include limiting the selectable date range, localizable strings and date formats,
a single date picker mode, optional time picker (for e.g. making appointments or reservations),
and styles that match the default Bootstrap 3 theme.
